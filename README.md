# 100-days-of-code
## 100-days-of-code is a challenge where I set myself the goal to code atleast for an hour everyday for the next 100 days
## I've started learning Data Structures through C++ and Algorithms

### Day-1 
        C++ program to reverse an array
        Example 1:
        Input  : array[] = {1, 2, 3}
        Output : array[] = {3, 2, 1}

        Example 2:
        Input :  array[] = {4, 5, 1, 2}
        Output : array[] = {2, 1, 5, 4}

### Day-2 
        C++ program to find the minimum and maximum elements in an array.
        Method 1 - By sorting the array 
        Method 2 - By Linear search

        Example:
        Input : array[] = {4, 5, 10, 25, 2, 3}
        Ouput : min = 2, max = 25
        
### Day-3 
        C++ program to find the kth smallest element in an array.

        Example:
        Input : array[] = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15}, k = 2
        Output : 7
        Explanation : k is 2, so 2nd smallest element is 7
        
### Day-4
        C++ program to sort the array of 0s, 1s, 2s in ascending order without using any sorting algorithm

        Given an array containing 0s, 1s, and 2s; you need to sort the array in ascending order.

        Example:
        Input : array[] = {2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1}
        Output : array[] = {0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2}

### Day-5
        C++ program to move all the negative numbers to the beginning of the array.

        An array contains both positive and negative numbers in random order.
        Rearrange the array elements so that all negative numbers appear before all positive numbers.

        Example:
        Input : 1, -5, -6, 10, 25, 33, -20
        Ouput : -20, -5, -6, 10, 25, 33, 1

        Note : Order of elements is not important here.
